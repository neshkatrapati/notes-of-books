## Introduction 
The Caste system is the edifice on which the Brahminism was built. As long as a people can abide by a caste hierarchy, they were subsumed by this system thus, enabling a greater expansion. Tribals and even sects who were heterodox can be assimilated into this umbrella because they still stick to the backbone : a rigorous hierarchy. This is the tool that is still being used today by the organised proponents of Brahminism, the RSS to assimilate areas which were previously not within reach like the North East. This is also probably why Indian versions of Christianity, Islam and also religions like Sikhism also have some sort of a caste system.
